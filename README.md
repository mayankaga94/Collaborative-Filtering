# Collaborative-Filtering
Recommendation system using collaborative filtering on a movie dataset.
The recommendation system uses the surprise library to make movie recommendations. This can be done to make recommendations based on user - user matching, item - item matching or using a hybrid system.
I used various algorithms and tested them against each other on several metrics.
The movie dataset can be downloaded from this link http://files.grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ml-100k.zip
